This is a project to practice mainly JavaScript! The game should originally funtion within the console.

I chose to add HTML elements to make this game playable without the console. Furthermore I added custom styling to all ellements.

The things I learnd:
- Making functions in JavaScript
- Adding eventListeners and changing HTML elements
- Designing the functions and having to plan everything
- Problemsolving of given Problems
- Working with a lot of flex in CSS
- Transition, box-shadow, opacity and scale in css
